# Number-System-Converter
This is a program that converts a number from one number system to another.

Yes, I know that python has a built-in function for that, but I did this to gain a better understanding of how
binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems are related to the decimal number system.

I'm a beginner, so please don't judge!

Thanks!
